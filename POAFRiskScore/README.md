This software calculates the risk of postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF) development in patients who have undergone Coronary Artery Bypass operation. In this project, many logistic regression estimation models were constructed by the important risk factors associated with POAF in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation, and current risk prediction tool was developed using the coefficients of the optimal model.
